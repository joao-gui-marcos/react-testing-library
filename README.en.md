# Welcome to the testing project repository with the React Testing Library!

## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

-   In this project you developed tests for a React application that is already created and configured, using[`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/)and the library[`React Testing Library`](https://testing-library.com/).
-   The application contains a complete implementation of a simplified Pok√©dex. For each requirement listed, I wrote tests that ensured its correctness. The tests were tested with Stryker, by creating mutants from code changes.

## Skills used:

-   Use React-Testing-Library selectors (queries) in automated tests;

-   Simulate events with React-Testing-Library in automated tests;

-   Test asynchronous logic flows with the React-Testing-Library;

-   Write tests that allow the refactoring of the application's components structure without having to be changed;

-   Testar inputs.

# requirements

# non-evaluative requirements

What we have below are not bonus requirements - they are ideas for you to delve deeper into the project and**learn more!**How about working on them? We start with something very straightforward:

  <details>
  <summary><strong>A cobertura de testes deve ser 100%</strong></summary>

-   To see the test coverage, run the command in the terminal`npm run test-coverage`.
    </details>

Furthermore, the Pok√©dex is a static application, with its pre-defined data. Using the[Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), you can make it more dynamic and realistic.

Implement the proposed requirements below and write tests for them. Always try to keep test coverage at 100%, thus ensuring that there is no untested code or logic flows. For an added challenge, try using TDD - write tests as you implement requirements.

-   <details><summary>Adicione uma rota para exibir uma lista de localiza√ß√µes</summary>

    -   The route URL must be`/locations`;

    -   The page should display a list of locations returned by the Pok√©API. You can read[here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#resource-lists-section)e[here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#locations-section)how to use the Pok√©API to fetch a list of locations.
        </details>

-   <details><summary>Adicione na barra de navega√ß√£o um link para a lista de localiza√ß√µes</summary>

    -   The link must contain the text`Locations`;

    -   When clicking on the link, the page with the list of locations should be displayed.
        </details>

-   <details><summary>Adicione bot√µes de pagina√ß√£o na lista de localiza√ß√µes.</summary>

    By default, the_endpoints_from the Pok√©API return a maximum of 20 results. Using the parameters`limit`e`offset`, you can specify which page you want to fetch and what size it is. Look[here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#resource-lists-section)how to use these parameters.

    -   Add two "Previous" and "Next" buttons that allow you to navigate between the locations list pages;

    -   On the first page, the "Back" button should be disabled. Likewise, when reaching the last page, the "Next" button should be disabled.
        </details>

-   <details><summary>Adiciona uma rota para exibir uma lista de gera√ß√µes.</summary>

    -   The route URL must be`/generations`;

    -   The page should display a list of generations returned by the Pok√©API. You can read[here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#resource-lists-section)e[here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#generations)how to use the Pok√©API to fetch a list of generations.
        </details>

-   <details><summary>Adicione na barra de navega√ß√£o um link para a lista de gera√ß√µes</summary>

    -   The link must contain the text`Generations`;

    -   When clicking on the link, the page with the list of generations should be displayed.
        </details>

-   <details><summary>Adicione uma rota para exibir informa√ß√µes sobre uma gera√ß√£o</summary>

    -   The route URL must be`/generations/<id>`, Where`<id>`is the id of the displayed generation;

    -   The page should display, after searching the Pok√©API, the name of the generation and a list with the names of the pok√©mons introduced in this generation.
        </details>

-   <details><summary>Adicione a cada gera√ß√£o na lista de gera√ß√µes um link para a p√°gina de detalhes desta gera√ß√£o</summary>

    -   When clicking on the link, the page with information about the clicked generation should be displayed.
        </details>
